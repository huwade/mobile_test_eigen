Quiz 1-2: Common Senses



When will we use F1-score instead of precision(accuracy)?
ans : 
    if you have an uneven class distribution. Accuracy works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives 
    and false negatives are very different, it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall. 
    

Why don’t we use binary classification function as the activation function in neural networks?
ans : 
    reduced likelihood of the gradient to vanish



What is the bias and variance of a machine learning algorithm?
ans :
    high bias under fitting, high variance overfitting



When training a single tree in random forest, we don’t prune the tree, why?
ans :
    

What is one-hot encoding?
ans : 
    將數字 0~9 轉成用 0 1 來表示，舉例來說 十個數字就十個維度，0 表示為 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
